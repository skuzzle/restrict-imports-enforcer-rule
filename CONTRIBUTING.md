If you want to actively contribute code, please follow this advice:
I don't want you to waste your time on changes that I might decline, so please open a new
issue before implementing any new feature and sending a pull request. I'm happy to
discuss your idea and give advice on how to best implement it.

If your idea is accepted, simply send the PR against the *development* branch.
Note that code formatting is enforced by `spotless`. You can apply the configured
formatting rules to your changes by running `./mvnw spotless:apply`
