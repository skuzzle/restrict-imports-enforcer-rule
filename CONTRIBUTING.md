Contributions are highly appreciated!

If you have any questions, feature requests or suspected bugs please do not hesitate to
open a new issue.

If you want to actively contribute code, please follow this advice:
I don't want you to waste your time on changes that I might decline, so please open a new
issue before implementing any new feature and sending a pull request. I'm happy to
discuss your idea and give advice on how to best implement it.

If your idea is accepted, simply send the PR against the *development* branch.
Note that code formatting is enforced by `spotless`. You can apply the configured
formatting rules to your changes by running `./gradlew spotlessApply`

## Note
When building the project locally gradle will ask you whether you want to accept the TOS of the public
Build Scan service:
> Publishing a build scan to scans.gradle.com requires accepting the Gradle Terms of Service defined at https://gradle.com/terms-of-service. Do you accept these terms? [yes, no]

You can safely decline this if you do not want to publish a Build Scan.
